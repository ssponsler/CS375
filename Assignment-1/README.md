I chose this generative rainforest landscape off of the browse list while looking around for a good example.
The comments of the main image reference a youtube video from the creator of how he made the landscape using math: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BFld4EBO2RE
I found it very interesting to discover that the trees were ellipsoids cluttered with noise, and the lower image resolution gives them the depth you would expect from
alternatively constructed trees.

**Tentative Proposal Topic: Sorting algorithm time efficiency demonstrated with animation**

Haven't had a lot of time to think this over, I may change it in the next few days. I would want to demonstrate the time efficiency of multiple sorting algorithms
by modifying either the animation speed of some object with how fast the sorting algorithm finishes. 
Scheduling:
Week 1 - Import sorting algorithms into JS, implement simple 3D object for testing
Week 2 - Implement functional modifications to object animation speed and rotation via enumerated speed values for sorting algorithms
Week 3 - Allow zoom, rotation, panning on object with mouse
Week 4 - Implement ability to insert custom sorting algorithm to see how it scales (special animation for failed/unsorted algorithm)
